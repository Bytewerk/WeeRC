WeeRC
=====

A Sailfish OS Weechat relaymote control client

Current Status
==============

There is no SailfishOS app yet. WeeRC is currently developed as a basic desktop
client in order to make the testing of the library easier. When it is
considered ready, the desktop code is ported to SailfishOS.

The following things do already work in the desktop version (test_libweerc):

* Low-level protocol parsing
* Buffer list detection
* Incoming messages are displayed immediately
* Buffer switching
* Sending messages to the current buffer
